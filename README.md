### Hi there, I'm Rob Morgan üëã

I'm an Australian üá¶üá∫ entrepreneur with experience in a wide range of technology companies. I work on a bunch of
open source projects (see below) and [blog](https://robmorgan.id.au/) about startups and tech.

In the past, I created and open-sourced the [Phinx](https://github.com/cakephp/phinx) (4.5k ‚≠êÔ∏è) database migrations tool, built [Patcher](https://blog.gruntwork.io/introducing-patcher-a-new-tool-for-keeping-infrastructure-code-up-to-date-e65b0c203b6b)
for updating DevOps dependencies and released a set of production-grade infrastructure modules for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/deploying-a-production-grade-helm-release-on-gke-with-terraform).
I also integrated GCP support into [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (An open-source IaC testing tool) and created a product for [hosting Magento on AWS](https://github.com/magecloudkit/magecloudkit).
