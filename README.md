### Hi there, I'm Rob Morgan 👋

I'm an Australian 🇦🇺 entrepreneur with experience in a wide range of technology companies. I'm currently working on
[InfraSpec](https://infraspec.sh) (a tool for testing cloud infrastructure in plain English) and
[Halo](https://github.com/robmorgan/halo) (a real-time lighting console for solo performers) and along with other open
source projects. I [blog](https://robmorgan.id.au/) about startups and tech.

In the past, I created [Phinx](https://github.com/cakephp/phinx) (4.5k ⭐️), a popular database migrations
tool, and built [Patcher](https://blog.gruntwork.io/introducing-patcher-a-new-tool-for-keeping-infrastructure-code-up-to-date-e65b0c203b6b)
to help teams keep DevOps dependencies up to date. I've also released a set of production-grade infrastructure modules for
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/deploying-a-production-grade-helm-release-on-gke-with-terraform).
