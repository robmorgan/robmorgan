### Hi there, I'm Rob Morgan üëã

I'm an Australian üá¶üá∫ entrepreneur with experience in a wide range of technology companies. I work on a bunch of
open source projects (see below) and [blog](https://robmorgan.id.au/) about startups and tech. You can [hire me](https://robmorgan.id.au/work-with-me/)
for your next project.

In the past, I created and released the [Phinx](https://github.com/cakephp/phinx) (4.4k ‚≠êÔ∏è) open-source database migrations tool
and released a set of production-grade infrastructure modules for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/deploying-a-production-grade-helm-release-on-gke-with-terraform).
I also integrated GCP support into [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (An open-source IaC testing tool) and created a product for [hosting Magento on AWS](https://github.com/magecloudkit/magecloudkit).
